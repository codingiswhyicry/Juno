Juno is an assistant for neurodivergent people that helps them better track their tasks, change their environments instantly when they need to, and to communicate their moods to those around them. Juno isn't so much meant to be a caretaker as it is an extension of the person who it's built for. It's not meant to take care of them, but to help them be more independent. 

Juno's goal is to help ease the pain points that neurodivergent people face without the insane cost and time-intensive process of building a custom, smart home / tech ecosystem for themselves. The specific pain points Juno is meant to help with is:

1. Tracking activities that someone has done. 
2. Communicating to others non-verbally their emotions in a discreet way, or when a meltdown is coming
3. Changing the user's environment without their input based on their mood to help them center themselves.

### General Disclaimer
As much as I want to make Juno as accessible as possible and to design for every edge case, Juno is being built for myself, and every ND person is different with what they can have in terms of sensory stuff. That's totally fine! 

But please note, I'm not able to design for every single ND person, so I am designing for myself. I am also not a representative of every single ND person, so although this system works for me, it might not work for you.

Please feel free to edit anything in here to make it more accessible for you and whatever you need it for! 

And please note that if you are someone who is neurotypical, building this for an ND person, that person might have different accessibility needs and may not be able to use it for one reason or another. Please check in with them before building it!
